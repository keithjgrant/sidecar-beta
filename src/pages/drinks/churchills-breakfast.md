Ignite the end of the cinnamon stick with a butane torch or gas burner. Invert a coupe or brandy snifter over the burning end so the smoke rises into the glass and coats the inside.

Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice. Shake vigorously. Strain into the smoke-coated glass.

Garnish with the burnt cinnamon stick.
