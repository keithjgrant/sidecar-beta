Chill a rocks glass in the freezer.

Pour a splash of absinthe into the glass; swirl it around to coat the inside of the glass, then pour it out.

Stir remaining ingredients with plenty of ice. Strain into the rocks glass (with no ice). Express oils from lemon twist into the drink, then [discard the peel](/techniques/twist/#discarding).
