intro: The right gin is essential in this cocktail. It cannot be overly piney or floral. Stick with Plymouth if you can. In a pinch, you can get away with Hendrick’s and its cucumber flavor. Most other gins I’ve tried have not fared as well.

[Stir](/techniques/stirring/) bitters, gin, and elderflower liqueur with plenty of ice. Strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice.

Express oils from grapefruit twist over the glass and rub the peel around the rim. Add peel to the glass.
