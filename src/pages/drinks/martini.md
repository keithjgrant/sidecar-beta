intro: Everyone has an opinion about martinis, and, I’ll be honest, mine is always changing. So here’s a great starting point. You might want to omit the bitters if you're not using a juniper-forward gin.

Add to cocktail shaker with plenty of ice. Stir well, then strain into a martini glass.

Garnish with a lemon twist.
