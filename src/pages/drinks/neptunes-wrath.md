intro: Lighting alcohol on fire can be dangerous. Do it over a bar mat or sink so a spill doesn’t spread and have a fire extinguisher nearby.

Add all ingredients except green chartreuse to a shaker. [Dry shake](techniques/shaking#dry-shaking). Add plenty of ice and shake vigorously. Strain into a large coupe or Nick & Nora glass.

In your jigger, measure ¼ Green Chartreuse. Light the alcohol on fire and wait a few moments. Then, being extremely careful not to spill, pour it into the cocktail.
