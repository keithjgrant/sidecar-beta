Vermouth is type of fortified wine with added hints of various herbs and spices. It’s a common ingredient in many cocktails, the most well-known being the [martini](/drinks/martini).

## Types of Vermouth

The two most common types of vermouth are *dry* and *sweet*. Dry vermouths (sometimes called “French vermouth”) are light in color, often with a hint of yellow. The quintessential dry vermouth drink is the [martini](/drinks/martini).

Sweet vermouths, often labelled “Rosso” or “Italian vermouth”, are reddish in color and sweeter tasting than dry vermouths. The best-known sweet vermouth drink is the [manhattan](/drinks/manhattan).

Another less common type of vermouth are “blanc” or “bianco”. Blanc vermouth is clear in color, but sweeter in flavor than a dry vermouth. These are delicious and I find the flavor in some ways reminiscent of Sherry.

There are also several aperitif wines that are not technically vermouth, but are fairly similar, such as _Cocchi American_ and _Lillet Blanc_.

### Brands

Vermouth is often under-appreciated, largely because old bottles of Martini & Rossi are all you will find in most home liquor cabinets. I recommend the following brands (my favorites at the top). You may need to visit a larger liquor store to find them.

* Dolin
* Cocchi
* Carpano
* Lillet
* Noilly Prat

The most readily-available brand of vermouth (in the U.S.) is _Martini & Rossi_. Their dry vermouth is passable but not great. I find their sweet vermouth overly medicinal and a quick way to ruin a drink.

## Storing Vermouth
Vermouth is made from wine, so **it goes bad**! Once you’ve opened a bottle, store it in your fridge. It will be good there for about three months.

If you’re unsure, taste a little. If it tastes bad, it’s bad. If you have an old dusty bottle on your shelf, throw it away.

Once you have some fresh, high quality vermouth, try out a [French Kiss](/drinks/french-kiss)
